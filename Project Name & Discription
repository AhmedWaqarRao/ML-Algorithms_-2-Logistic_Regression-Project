Analyzing Advertising Dataset to Predict Ad Click using Logistic RegressionAnalyzing Advertising Dataset to Predict Ad Click using Logistic Regression

Using advertising.csv dataset we try to predict whether a user based on different input parameters
such as age, daily time spent on site, daily internet usage etc clicked on ad or not.
We use Logistic Regression and provide input parameters and try to predict output label which is clicked on ad. 
We also cleaned the data, and converted some continuous data to categorical data in order to extract maximum information from the data.
